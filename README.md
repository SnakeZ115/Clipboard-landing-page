## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I learned a lot about CSS Grid and Flexbox because I needed to use both display in order to accomodate the elements in bigger screens. In this project I used a Mobile-first workflow, I think this is the best for me because I find it easy to adapte thing from smaller screens to bigger screens.

### Continued development

In future projects I will try to have an order with my CSS classes because I think I made a little mess so, I had to correct and I think they are understandable.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive design breakpoints](https://dev.to/gerryleonugroho/responsive-design-breakpoints-2025-playbook-53ih) - This helped me to have some base widths to work with in media queries.
- [Mobile-first vs Desktop-first](https://franciscoamk.com/mobile-first-vs-desktop-first/) - This one helped me decide which workflow I should use by reading about its pros and cons. It's a great article.
